## The Image
☷ Earth\

### Ancient Commentary on the Image
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | image says |
| 地 中 生 木 | within the earth is born a tree |
| 升 | slow-growing |
| 君 子 以 順 德 | noble-ones, therefore, submit virtuously |
| 積 小 以 高 大 | accumulate gradually, therefore, tall and large |
<br />


### My Comments on the Image
the way a tree becomes big and tall\
is by humbly drawing its strength from below the earth\
gradually building itself up over a long period of time\
in an unrelenting conquest.
<br />
<br />

| 初 六 | 6 at the bottom |
| 允 升 大 | allowing slow-growing large |
| 吉 | good fortune |
<br />


### Ancient Commentary on Line 1
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | image says |
| 允 升 大 吉 | "allowing slow-growing large, good fortune" |
| 上 合 志 也 | the potential matches the ambition |
<br />

### My Comments on Line 1:
I believe what that says is...
the good fortune of allowing for slow growth in order to accomplish something huge is
that the potential amount of growth is as large as your ambitions.

when we employ rapid growth (rather than allow slow-growing) often the result is that we reach a ceartain height, but it wasnt as high as our ambition intended.

### My Comments on Line 2
Slow growth requires faith and sacrifice.

what kind of faith?

faith that those sacrifices will bear fruits of joy.

| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | image says |
| 王 用 亨 于 岐 山 | "the king uses success to climb magestic mountains" |
| 順 事 也 | within the realm of his affairs |
<br />

### My Comments on Line 4
the king (whomever the tree is below).
will let the tree's successful growth climb mountains for him.

but the tree can only grow within the realm of the king.
the tree doesn't wander off climbing its own mountains.
<br />

<br />
        
### My Comments on Line 5
by using the virtues of slow-growing,
gradually working one's way up the ranks brings good forutine,
since, given time, a person can rise to the level of thier ambition.

### My Comments on Line 6
You need deep roots in order to have a tall tree.

and the big trees, with the deep roots, always have the necessary resources.
