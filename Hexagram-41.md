### My Comments on the Judgement
The mountain (the firm, the above) is letting go of the lake (the gentle, the below).

Giving her autonimy, freedom to do as she will.  And trusting her judgement.

The two offering baskets ... I think are resources that the Mountain is granting the lake, water flowing from the mountiain into the lake, which the mountain no longer controls.
The question is ... what was the mountain going to do with those extra baskets of grain anyway?

The lake has use for those resources, and the mountain really can do without.  So the mountain should let go of it.

This grants time together walking ... or ... this creates a relationship of cooperation, but not ownership.

Maybe the mountain should take a vacation and give the lake a little space to do her thing.  Let go man.

### Ancient Commentary on the Image
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 山 下 有 澤 | The mountain below-having a lake |
| 損 | letting go |
| 君 子 以 | noble-ones, therefore, |
| 懲 忿 | discipline their anger |
| 窒 欲 | hold back their desires |
<br />


### My Comments on the Image
The relationship between a Mountain and a Lake, when the lake is at the bottom of the mountain, is one where the mountain provides continual water, but the lake is free from the mountain.

All of the water that finds its way from the mountain to the lake, was water the mountain no longer needed. it was run-off, surplus.  So, it needs to LET GO of that water. No strings attached.  Let the lake be a lake, and stop acting like he owns her.

The noble-mountain, in this situation, lets go of his negative feelings about and his hopeful desires for the lake.  Noble-mountains recognize the lakes autonomy, and restrain their overbearing influence.  A terranical mountain is a terrible thing to have towering over you.

### My Comments on Line 5
Sometimes its important to maintain one's ability to be self-sufficient.

a "turtle" is ussually a reference to consulting the yi-jing.  (anciently, consulting the oracle included using a turtle-shell as a bowl for holding the bones used when casting).

To me, this is saying ... even when 10 friends claim they know what's best for you (having consulted thier oracles), maintaining some autonomy is valuable.
