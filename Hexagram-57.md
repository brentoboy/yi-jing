### Ancient Commentary on the Image
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 隨 風 |  Bowing to the winds ... Submission |
| 君 子 以 申 命 行 事 | So, noble ones report on assigned responsibilites |
<br />


### My Comments on the Image
Bowing ... accepting, being humble, going along with, not resisting
the winds ... the circumstances nature presents, the "wind" barked out by those above you, the "times", anything beyond our direct influence, or beyond our control
<br />

### Ancient Commentary on Line 1

| 象 曰 | image says |
| 進 退 | Advancing, retreating |
| 志 疑 也 | Convictions wavering? |
| 利 武 人 之 貞 | Benefit from the virtue of the soldier |
| 志 治 也 | Convictions harnessed! |
<br />

### My Comments on Line 1:
This is about submission to the winds of circumstance

And about bending all over the place, 
as the winds blow to and fro

Soldiers go to and fro, 
but they do it in submission to their commanders

thereby harnessing their convictions, 
rather than watch them chase every crazy idea.

however, its still an act of submission

it seems to imply that its better to submit to someone or something with purpose, 
rather than anything and everything that presents itself

| 紛 若 之 吉 | Seeming haphazard's good fortune |
| 得 中 也 | Obtaining the center! |
<br />


### My Comments on Line 2
This is in submitting youself to the ideas of others

Even in things that are none of their business

It might seem a bit haphazard, but maybe "serendipidous" is a better term

You may discover things about yourself you didnt know, and become more complete (and a better lover)

| 志 窮 也 | Convictions exhausted! |
<br />


### My Comments on Line 3
This seems to be about continuous submission.

It dries you up and turns you into a grumpy old miser.

you lose your own purpose if you always carry out the purposes of others

because, in the end you have nothing left to give

### My Comments on Line 5
This one seems to be about submitting to natural law

sometimes you have, sometimes you lack, and accepting that reality is how you submit to it

kind of like immediately before the harvest and immediatly after.

you need to be willing to bow to the changes that are delivered with the winds of time in order to reap that harvest, and fighting against it wont change much

| 象 曰 | image says |
| 巽 在 床 下 | Submission in bed |
| 上 窮 也 | Utmost poverty! |
| 喪 其 資 | Wasting one's resources |
| 斧 正 乎 | Axing principles? |
| 凶 也 | Ominous! |
<br />


### My Comments on Line 6
Seems to be about submitting to lusts and appetites

Being tossed about by the winds of one's own inrefined impulses

Interestingly, there are two images in this set about sexual submission, 
both using sex as examples of different kinds of submission

this one is about losing control of your own appetites, 
the other is about being open to the ideas of others,
both are about one's sex life (as a metaphore).

this one is bad because you are a slave to your own appetites,
and the result is blowing your time, money, wealth, principles, reputation, etc.

the other is good because you expand your horizens and try new things, becoming more than you were before.
apparently, submission can be good or bad, and you have to be careful which winds you decide to bow yourself to.

I guess the winds of inner animal desires are not the right thing to bow and submit yourself to. 
they are terrible task masters.
