### Ancient Commentary on the Image
| Original | English Translation |

| 大 人 以 繼 明 照 于 四 方 | great-ones, therefore, leave behind brilliance, illuminating all 4 directions |
<br />


### My Comments on the Image
<br />
<br />


## Line 1
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 初 九 | 9 at the bottom |
| 履 錯 然 敬 之 | respecting those who walk with uncertainty |
| 無 咎 | this is not wrong |
<br />


### Ancient Commentary on Line 1
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | image says |
| 履 錯 之 敬 |  |
| 以 辟 咎 也 |  |
<br />

### My Comments on Line 1:
not everyone has sunlight as they walk (in reality, and in metaphor)\
particularly drunk people (who often stagger in the dark)\
"respect" a drunkard, keep yourself from danger\
<br />
<br />


## Line 2
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 六 二 | 6 at the second |
| 黃 離 | yellow lasting-light |
| 元 吉 | foundation of good fortune |
<br />


### Ancient Commentary on Line 2
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | image says |
| 黃 離 元 吉 |  |
| 得 中 道 也 |  |
<br />


### My Comments on Line 2
I think this one is clear ... and yet says nothing\
sunlight: good.\
um, ok, ... what does that mean?\
celestial light is hope, it is desire, energy/motivation, inspiring
<br />
<br />


## Line 3
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 九 三 | 9 at the third |
| 日 昃 之 離 | The lasting-light of the sun diminishing |
| 不 鼓 缶 而 歌 | if not beating drums and singing |
| 則 大 耋 之 嗟 凶 | then the sighs of old-age will be terrible |
<br />


### Ancient Commentary on Line 3
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | image says |
| 日 昃 之 離 |  |
| 何 可 久 也 |  |
<br />


### My Comments on Line 3
just as the sun sets at the end of a day, the fire of youth dies out at the end of our life.

if we don't enjoy the fire while it burns (singing, dancing) we will have great regret as see it die out.
<br />
<br />

## Line 4
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 九 四 | 9 at the fourth |
| 突 如 其 來 如 | suddenly, it arrives |
| 焚 如 | burns up |
| 死 如 | dies out |
| 棄 如 | then left behind |
<br />

### Ancient Commentary on Line 4
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | image says |
| 突 如 其 來 如 |  |
| 无 所 容 也 |  |
<br />

### My Comments on Line 4
This describes a flash fire\
it describes a day\
it describes a life\
it describes an idea\
it describes the sun, having no where to lodge, so continually traveling
<br />
<br />


## Line 5
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 六 五 | 6 at the 5th |
| 出 涕 沱 若 | giving off tears as the rivers |
| 戚 嗟 若 | sorrowful as a sigh |
| 吉 | good fortune |
<br />

### Ancient Commentary on Line 5
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | image says |
| 六 五 之 吉 |  |
| 離 王 公 也 |  |
<br />
        
### My Comments on Line 5
even tragedy ends with hope (like all extremes, it causes rebound of its counterpart)

lasting-light, within, is hope
<br />
<br />


## Line 6
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 上 九 | 9 at the top |
| 王 用 出 征 | the king dispatches a conquest |
| 有 嘉 折 首 | rejoices, having broken the leadership |
| 獲 匪 其 醜 | captures the underlings |
| 無 咎 | which is not wrong |
<br />
    

### Ancient Commentary on Line 6
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | image says |
| 王 用 出 征 |  |
| 以 正 邦 也 |  |
<br />


### My Comments on Line 6
um, not sure what this has to do with Lasting-Light\
the "king" is theoretically divinely appointed\
its his job to maintain peace, order, and stuff\
so he dispatches troops to squash a rebellion\
but doesn't kill the rank-and-file rebels, just the instigators\
is that saying .. without their "leader/fire/light" the bad guys fall\
does it mean by exposing the problem to divine light, it dissipates on its own\
what does this have to do with light? fire? brilliance? the sun? days? or ... ?
