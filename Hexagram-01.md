## The Image

**Hexagram**: ䷀

**Above (the outer universe)**: [Heaven](Trigram-Heaven.md) : Heaven - Leading Energy

**Below (the inner universe)**: [Heaven](Trigram-Heaven.md) : Heaven - Leading Energy


### Ancient Commentary on the Image
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | Image says |
| 天 行 健 | The heavens continue onward in strength |
| 君 子 以 自 強 不 息 | Noble ones, therefore, apply themselves without ceasing |


### My Comments on The Image
the virtue of this hexagram seems to be persistent effort

the other 7 double-trigram hexagrams (2 of the same trigram) talk about 'repeating' the subject of the trigram

heaven / sky / day / sun ... repeats in the daily cycle.
So, the commentary seems to be about the repetitious nature of heaven,
and how it is very consistent and dependable,
and provides its strength day after day after day.

In his book,
Cleary suggests the idea that the dragon referred to in this hexagram's lines
is the Azure Dragon constellation (the dragon of the skies).

In other commentaries (some ancient),
the dragon is the person who is in a position to act without hindrance.
I assume that usually means the person seeking wisdom from the yi-jing.

In this sense, the dragon is both the outer universe (the season)
and the inner universe (the preson in a position to act boldly, according to the season).



### My Comments on the Glyph
the Chinese character for this symbol contains the following (in my opinion - mostly from Alfred Yuang's book)
the **sun** (squire box with horizontal line in it on the left side of the symbol)
a **small plant** growing up from the sun (the sun being the foundation of growth)
a **root** from the plant visible below the sun, going deep into **the ground**
on the right hand side, side-ways 'T' at the top is **the horizon, the sky, or heavens**
the upside down 2 under the sky is the celestial yang **chi energy** of the sun flowing down from heaven and sweeping across all-under-heaven.

"heaven and earth are not bias" (Laozi - DaoDeJing #2).

"for the father causeth the sun to shine and the rain to fall on the just as well as the unjust" (Jesus - Matt 5:45).

"today while the sun shines, work with a will ... your duties fulfill" (LDS hymn)

## Line 1
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 初 九 | 9 at the bottom |
| 潛 龍 | Hiding dragon |
| 勿 用 | Don't use |


### Ancient Commentary on Line 1
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | Image says |
| 潛 龍 勿 用 | "Hiding dragon don't use" |
| 陽 在 下 也 | Yang occupies the lower! |

I believe this is in reference to line 1 (the lowliest line) is "yang" but it is not his "place" to act as the dragon.


### My Commentary on Line 1:

If the dragon in this imagery is the constellation,
then this is the season where the dragon is completely hidden from view,
and the strength of the heavens are useless,
the heavens can gift you with the best weather,
but if the season is wrong,
stuff wont grow.

If the dragon is a person
then this is about a person who has the skills and opportunity,
but, for some reason, is unable or unwilling to take action.

Combine those two thoughts, and this line seems to say...
The dragon knows that now is not the season of action.


## Line 2
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 九 二 | 9 at the 2nd |
| 見 龍 在 田 | Seeing the dragon in the fields |
| 利 見 大 人 | Beneficial to see great people |


### Ancient Commentary on Line 2
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | Image says |
| 見 龍 在 田 | "Seeing the dragon in the fields" |
| 德 施 普 也 | Virtues bestowed everywhere! |

this appears to me to be saying ... when the enabling energy of the dragon fills the feilds
the virtue is distributed far and wide.
this is the "De" virtue, as in "Dao De Jing".
In the Dao De Jing, virtue is portrayed as self-less activity benefiting others.

So: "bountiful harvest, everyone benefits" is the expected result of seeing a dragon in the fields


### My Commentary on Line 2
the sequence "利見大人" happens somewhat commonly throughout the book

[利 benefit] [見 to see] [大 large] [人 person]

to me it suggests that there is value to be found in the advice or examples of people with experience.

the text leaves it kind of ambiguous as to what "see" means.
if it says "see" a doctor is it saying "visit a doctor and converse" or is it saying "watch a doctor to see what they do" ?


## Line 3
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 九 三 | 9 at the 3rd |
| 君 子 終 日 乾 乾 | noble-ones at the end of a day of the most radiant energy |
| 夕 惕 若 厲 | In the evening are still alert and aware |
| 無 咎 | Which is not wrong |


### Ancient Commentary on Line 3
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | Image says |
| 終 日 乾 乾 | "At the end of a day of the most radiant energy" |
| 反 復 道 也 | Rather than returning to the Way(Dao)! |

I have no opinion on what he's saying there yet, not sure I even follow his logic at all.


### My Commentary on Line 3

i find it interesting that this one isnt about a dragon


## Line 4
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 九 四 | 9 at the 4th |
| 或 躍 在 淵 | (It) Might jump out of the depths |
| 無 咎 | Which is not wrong |
                

### Ancient Commentary on Line 4
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | Image says |
| 或 躍 在 淵 | "Might jump out of the dephts" |
| 進 | Making progress |
| 無 咎 也 | Which is not wrong! |


### My Commentary on Line 4
First a quick word on "無咎"
[無Lacking] [咎Mistake]
This sequence appears all over the place in this book.

Whenever I see it I can hear jerry seinfeld in the background "not that there's anything wrong with that".

Much of this book is about what is or isn't the ideal choice.
This seems to be encouragement ... "its ok, not worry about it"

anyway ... line 4 ... the image here is about the dragon jumping out of its hiding place.
The Azure Dragon jumps out from the horizon during the season where it is moving from hiding into dominance in the night sky.
The assumption is that we are in the season when that is going on.

The ancient commentator seems to be saying "we are getting there" ... or "its progress", be happy with what you have, its not a bad situation.

To me, this is saying, you are in a season of progress "keep jumping".


## Line 5
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 九 五 | 9 at the 5th |
| 飛 龍 在 天 | Flying dragon in the heavens |
| 利 見 大 人 | Beneficial to see great people |


### Ancient Commentary on Line 5
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | Image says |
| 飛 龍 在 天 | "Flying dragon in the heavens" |
| 大 人 造 也 | great people are productive! |


### My Commentary on Line 5

this line seems to be the ideal line for the Gua.

the dragon of the sky is in full glory.

the dragons of the earth are in a season of great productivity.


## Line 6
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 上 九| 9 at the top |
| 亢 龍 有 悔 | Stiff-necked dragon will have regret |


### Ancient Commentary on Line 6
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | Image says |
| 亢 龍 有 悔 | "Stiff-necked dragon will have regret" |
| 盈 不 可 久 也 | un-fill-able for a long season! |


### My Commentary on Line 6
This line specifically drives the imagery of 
the Azure Dragon constellation home for me,
because the 亢 symbol is the symbol 
that is the name of the sub-constellation 
that forms the neck of the Azure Dragon.

The dragon rises up to the zenith of its height 
in the night sky, at which point, 
it has no where to go but down.

So, the dragon at the pinnacle of his pride, 
falls and then hides himself for a season.

Which all goes nicely with the DaoDeJing concept that, 
upon reaching one extreme (yin/yang) 
the logical next step is to return to toward the other.


## All 9s
This Gua has a thing that the others don't have
ALL lines.  (if all lines are moving)

| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 用 九 | Using 9s (when all are 9s) |
| 見 群 龍 無 首 | Seeing a group of dragons without a chief |
| 吉 | Good fortune |


### Ancient Commentary on All 9s
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | Image says |
| 用 九 | Using 9s (when all are 9s) |
| 天 德 不 可 為 首 也 | Heavenly virtue does not employ chiefs! |


### My Commentary on All 9s
I'm not entirly sure what the intended meaning here is.

However, it is an interesting observation that, 
if you get a group of earthly dragons (skilled, capable people who are in a position to accomplish something)
and the heavenly season of productivity is in full swing,
It would be incredible if those dragons would work together without vying for leadership dominance.
And ego-free dream team.... would indeed be be heavenly.

the other thing worth commenting on is that this is the only Gua that has this 7th section where all lines are moving.
I'm not sure what to make of that.

Those who consider the yi-jing a handbook of inner alchemy consider this moment to be the goal ... where the inner iron turns to gold.
