| 初 六 | 6 at the bottom |
| 履 霜 | walking on frost |
| 堅 冰 至 | eventually solid ice |

| 象 曰 | image says |
| 履 霜 堅 冰 |  |
| 陰 始 凝 也 |  |
| 馴 致 其 道 |  |
| 至 堅 冰 也 |  |
<br />


### My Comments on Line 1:
This doesn't necessarily say that your situation is one of frostiness becoming ice.

It is an observation that once you begin to see the signs of change, the full change is inevitable, just as early signs of winter are sure predictors of winter's eventual arrival.

Also, note that the Open fields of the earth remain true and devoted even when unproductivly buried below the ice.

And, that this is normal and natural for a season, and given some time, it too will pass.

| 地 道 光 也 |  |
<br />


### My Comments on Line 2
In the ancient Chinese world-view, the earth was a vast square, and the heavens a huge circular dome.
The words for straight and square and vast, when applied to people have meanings like
* straight => honest (not crooked)
* square => consistent (not haphazard)
* vast => open, welcoming (not closed, or seclusive)
The idea seems to be, we can walk the path that the earth walks (mimic these properties), follow the 'Dao' of earth
we can be more genuine (un-rehearsed), and more compassionate (not lacking generosity)
this moving line says, an attempt at embodiment of these qualities of the earth would be a good, considering the present situation.

### My Comments on Line 3
You may end up having to casually hide your super powers in order to devote yourself to public service
no one cares how awesome you are, its not about you, its about what needs to be done, and being supportive
it may be a thankless job, but it really needs someone with extensive experience.

| 慎 不 害 也 |  |
<br />


### My Comments on Line 4
The virtue in this line seems to be humility or restraint.
Having something, doesn't mean you have to flaunt it.

What I'm not seeing is how that image 
(hiding something valuable out of view) 
is being projected out into the greater image of earth and open fields.

Perhaps planting a seed out of view 
is the thing that makes it become greater, 
and the fact that you had to set it aside and out of view 
in order for it to become fruitful..?

### My Comments on Line 5
so, all of this is from various sources, 
I didn't "invent" either of these 2 points:
* a yellow underskirt is what the scholars wear under their educational cap and gown robes.
* yellow is also the color associated with the element of earth

In this image, symbolically, yellow is a foundation for good fortune.
The virtue I think that is being suggested here in the imagery is
that the earth suggests that you should be useful yet mild.
A gentleman and a scholar.

## Line 6

| 上 六 | 6 at the top |
| 戰 龍 於 野 | The dragon fights the horizon |
| 其 血 玄 黃 | Which bleeds a mysterious yellow |
<br />
    

### Ancient Commentary on Line 6

| -: | -- |
| 象 曰 | image says |
| 龍 戰 于 野 |  |
| 其 道 窮 也 |  |
<br />


### My Comments on Line 6
to me, this is a reference to the Azure Dragon. The Chinese constellation.
[hexagram 1](Hexagram-01.md) describes the dragon constellation in his various seasonal positions
this season is as the constellation has begun to 'set' out on the horizon
as though fighting to say above the earth before disappearing until next year.

it is a battle that the dragon eventually loses to the earth
the earth / horizon bleeds yellow because yellow is the color of dust, earth, and perhaps occasionally the Chinese sunset at this time of year

if this is indeed the intended image, the message is that the earth outlasts the seasons, it even outlasts a bloody battle with the great dragon."
the 'top most' virtue of the earth is that it outlasts all that oppose it.

As Laozi says, "the most yielding of all substances under heaven outlast the most forceful" (DaoDeJing #43).
