### The Origin of the solid and broken "Yao" lines

| 昔 者 聖 人 之 作 易 也 | The ancient sages who wrote the Changes("Yi") |
| 幽 贊 於 神 明 而 生 蓍 | were peacefully guided by divine illumination, and gave birth to the yarrow (method) |
| 參 天 兩 地 而 倚 數 | 3: heaven, 2: earth, and relying upon the counting. |
| 觀 變 於 陰 陽 而 立 卦 | observed the transformations of yin yang, and drafted the "Gua" |
| 發 揮 於 剛 柔 而 生 爻 | coming forth then fading away as firm then yeilding, and gave birth to the Lines("Yao") |
| 和 順 於 道 德 而 理 於 義 | harmoniously following the Way("Dao") Virtues("De") and maintained by integrity |
| 窮 理 盡 性 以 至 於 命 | humble maintenance exhausted, thereby reaching life's fullness. |

#### summary so far .. 
There were ancient sages, who took the time to contemplate the universe.
They were inspired to use yarrow sticks as a method of divination.
They counted the yarrow sticks, and 3 meant heaven, and 2 meant earth.  (I assume they took a handful, and subdivided it until they ended up with either 2 or 3 remaining sticks ... and used that to draw inspiration).
Heaven/Earth being the original two "gua" (answers they could get by consulting yarrow sticks).
The gua were "drawn" using lines called "yao".
A solid line was used to draw a yao that was "firm" or "yang" (a property of heaven).
A broken line was used to draw a yao that was "yeilding" or "yin" (a property of earth).
After divining the situation, the sages could live in accordance with the Dao of the moment.
They used this insight to manage thier lives in Virtue("De"), 
In harmony with the Way("Dao") they emptied themselves until they reached life's fullness (died).



### Origins of Hexagrams with 6 changing lines

| 昔 者 聖 人 之 作 易 也 | The ancient sages who wrote the Changes("Yi") |
| 將 以 順 性 命 之 理 | leading a submissive life maintained it |
| 是 以 立 天 之 道 曰 陰 與 陽 | through this drafted heaven's way in terms of yin together-with yang |
| 立 地 之 道 曰 柔 與 剛 | drafted earth's way in terms of the yeilding and the firm |
| 立 人 之 道 曰 仁 與 義 | drafted up man's way in terms of mercy and justice  |
| 兼 三 才 而 兩 之 | combined the 3 into units and paired them |
| 故 易 六 畫 而 成 卦 | resulting in 6 changing("yi") lines becoming a hexagram("Gua")   |
| 分 陰 分 陽 | distinguishing the yin, distinguishing the yang |
| 迭 用 柔 剛 | alternately using the yeilding, the firm |
| 故 易 六 位 而 成 章 | old changes("yi") in 6 positions completing their cycle |


#### summary so far...
The sages built on their original observation (that yin and yang are a cycle).\
They realized that when they heavens cycle between yin and yang it is darkness and light, day and night.\
And, the earth also has both firm and yeilding, but it manifests as soft and hard (like dirt and stone).\
And, that man also alternates between firm (justice, righteousness, integrity, strict) and yeilding (mercy, compassion, leniant).\
Since all three of these yao lines can alternate independently of each other, they can be combined together into "Trigrams" that together represent the yin-yang balance of the universe at a moment.\
Three lines, each of which can be yin or yang, can be arranged in 8 possible permutations (the "Ba Gua" ... or 8 Trigrams).\
The "Jump" from 3 line trigrams to 6 line hexagrams isn't described here other than that they "doubled" them (I translated it as "paired" them up).\
The Yi-Jing text describes them in multiple relationships, such as Above/Below Outside/Inside.  My assumption is that the daoist concept of an inner universe that is a reflection of the outer universe (and just as large, in a different way) is at play.\
If Heaven + Earth + Man = the Universe and there is an inner universe and an outer universe, that would explain the jump to 6 line hexagrams.  But this text doesn't say anything about "why" only that they doubled the trigrams.\
The resulting hexagrams can have change in any of thier six lines, or none of them.\
After all changing lines finish their change, the current moment/image is completed and this chapter is over.\



### Introducing the Ba-gua (8 Trigrams)
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 天 地 定 位 | Heaven and Earth fixed in positions  |
| 山 澤 通 氣 | Mountain and Lake interacting with the air("qi") |
| 雷 風 相 薄 | Thunder and Wind images upside-down |
| 水 火 不 相 射 | Water and Fire images not exposing  |
| 八 卦 相 錯 | The 8("Ba") Trigram("Gua") images interchanging |
| 數 往 者 順 | the numbers which agreed with their previous |
| 知 來 者 逆 | know that those will next be thier opposite |
| 是 故 易 逆 數 也 | which is why, change("yi") to opposite that number |

this seems to be describing the images (drawn pictures) of each trigram, not the personality or spirit of the trigrams.\
the heaven/earth are fixed (all the same, one or the other firm/yeilding)\
the mountain/lake have thier changes at the top (the different one is exposed to the air above)\
the thunder/wind are mirror opposites of those, but in reverse order (the odd-yao-out is at the bottom)\
the water/fire trigrams are not open on one side, but instead contain thier odd-yao-out internally\
that makes 8 distinct images that can be drawn.

when a yao line in a given position (line number) has been either yin or yang, and is "old" (was the same kind previously)
we know that that line number is due for a change to move toward its opposite.

this is the first mention that they make of how/why lines "change". ... as the ddj repeatedly emphasises, once you reach an extreme of one energy (be it yin or yang) that energy fades and the other begins to gather to fill its place.
the idea here being that any (or all, or none) of the lines might be "old" lines, ready for change.

the way that the "The 8("Ba") Trigram("Gua") images interchanging" happes is by means of changing lines.  for instance if you start with earth (all three yin) but the middle line is changing, then you will soon have water (a yang line surrounded by 2 yin).
