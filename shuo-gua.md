## The Origin of the solid and broken "Yao" lines
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 昔 者 聖 人 之 作 易 也 | The ancient sages who wrote the Changes("Yi") |
| 幽 贊 於 神 明 而 生 蓍 | were peacefully guided by divine illumination, and gave birth to the yarrow (method) |
| 參 天 兩 地 而 倚 數 | 3: heaven, 2: earth, and relying upon the counting. |
| 觀 變 於 陰 陽 而 立 卦 | observed the transformations of yin yang, and drafted the "Gua" |
| 發 揮 於 剛 柔 而 生 爻 | coming forth then fading away as firm then yeilding, and gave birth to the Lines("Yao") |
| 和 順 於 道 德 而 理 於 義 | harmoniously following the Way("Dao") Virtues("De") and maintained by integrity |
| 窮 理 盡 性 以 至 於 命 | humble maintenance exhausted, thereby reaching life's fullness. |

<br />

### summary so far .. 
There were ancient sages, who took the time to contemplate the universe.
They were inspired to use yarrow sticks as a method of divination.
They counted the yarrow sticks, and 3 meant heaven, and 2 meant earth.  (I assume they took a handful, and subdivided it until they ended up with either 2 or 3 remaining sticks ... and used that to draw inspiration).
Heaven/Earth being the original two "gua" (answers they could get by consulting yarrow sticks).
The gua were "drawn" using lines called "yao".
A solid line was used to draw a yao that was "firm" or "yang" (a property of heaven).
A broken line was used to draw a yao that was "yeilding" or "yin" (a property of earth).
After divining the situation, the sages could live in accordance with the Dao of the moment.
They used this insight to manage thier lives in Virtue("De"), 
In harmony with the Way("Dao") they emptied themselves until they reached life's fullness (died).

## Three domains ... for yin and yang expression
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 昔 者 聖 人 之 作 易 也 | The ancient sages who wrote the Changes("Yi") |
| 將 以 順 性 命 之 理 | leading a submissive life maintained it |
| 是 以 立 天 之 道 曰 陰 與 陽 | through this drafted heaven's way in terms of yin together-with yang |
| 立 地 之 道 曰 柔 與 剛 | drafted earth's way in terms of the soft and the hard |
| 立 人 之 道 曰 仁 與 義 | drafted up man's way in terms of mercy and justice  |

<br />

### summary so far...
The sages built on their original observation (that yin and yang are a cycle).\
They realized that when they heavens cycle between yin and yang it is darkness and light, day and night.\
And, the earth also has both firm and yeilding, but it manifests as soft and hard (like dirt and stone, water and ice).\
And, that man also alternates between firm (justice, righteousness, integrity, strictness) and yeilding (mercy, compassion, leniancy).

## 3 x 2 = 6
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 兼 三 才 而 兩 之 | combined the 3 into units and paired them |
| 故 易 六 畫 而 成 卦 | resulting in 6 changing("yi") lines becoming a hexagram("Gua")   |
| 分 陰 分 陽 | distinguishing the yin, distinguishing the yang |
| 迭 用 柔 剛 | alternately using the yeilding, the firm |
| 故 易 六 位 而 成 章 | old changes("yi") in 6 positions completing their cycle |

<br />


### summary so far...
Since the energies of the heaven, earth, and man, can alternate independently of each other, they can be combined together into "Trigrams" that together represent the yin-yang balance of the universe at a moment.\
Ok, it doesn't say that, it just says that they combined them into trigrams (images with 3 lines).

The "Jump" from 3 line trigrams to 6 line hexagrams isn't described here other than that they "doubled" them (I translated it as "paired" them up).\

The Yi-Jing text describes them in multiple relationships, such as Above/Below Outside/Inside.\
There is a new-agey philosophy that there are 2 universes, one outside of us, and one inside of us.\
The Macro and the Micro.  The Above, and the Below. ... I believe the 6 line hexagrams are representing this dual-universe concept.\
If Heaven + Earth + Man = the Universe\
and there is an inner universe and an outer universe,\
that would explain the jump to 6 line hexagrams.  

But this text doesn't say any of that. It only says that they 2'ed the trigrams together.\
The resulting hexagrams can have change in any of thier six lines, or none of them.\
After all changing lines finish their change, the current moment/image is completed and this chapter is over (the "cycle is complete").

## The images of the Ba-gua (8 Trigrams)
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 天 地 定 位 | Heaven and Earth fixed in positions  |
| 山 澤 通 氣 | Mountain and Lake interacting with the air("qi") |
| 雷 風 相 薄 | Thunder and Wind images condescend |
| 水 火 不 相 射 | Water and Fire images not exposing  |

<br />

### My take on what that just said
this seems to be describing the images (drawn pictures) of each trigram, not the personality or spirit of the trigrams.\
the heaven(☰) / earth(☷) are fixed (all the same, one or the other firm/yeilding)\
the mountain(☶) / lake(☱) have thier changes at the top (the different one is exposed to the air above)\
the thunder(☳) / wind(☴) have thier changes at the bottom, but in reverse order (the odd-yao-out is at the bottom)\
the water(☵) / fire(☲) trigrams are not open on one side, but instead contain thier odd-yao-out internally\
that makes 8 distinct images that can be drawn.
<br />
<br />


## The transitions of the Ba-gua (8 Trigrams)
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 八 卦 相 錯 | The 8("Ba") Trigram("Gua") images interchanging |
| 數 往 者 順 | the numbers which agreed with their previous |
| 知 來 者 逆 | know that those will next be thier opposite |
| 是 故 易 逆 數 也 | which is why, change("yi") to opposite that number |

<br />

### My take on what that just said
"the numbers" are positions, or line numbers.  the yao lines are numbered from 1 to 6, starting at the bottom.

"numbers which agreed with thier previous" are yao lines that are the same kind of line as what they were previously.  Meaning, whichever energy they are (be it yin or yang), they have been that way long enough to have become full.  

"know that those will next be their opposite" means that those lines which have reached that fullness of energy, be it yin or yang, ... you know that those are about to transition to the opposite energy.

So, if line 2 has been yang for some time, then it has built up to a fullness of yang energy.  it is a "moving" line, or a changing line.  Its the line where the Change(Yi) is.  The Yi-Jing is the Book about those changes.

the idea here being that any (or all, or none) of the lines might be "old" lines, ready for change.

the way that the "The 8("Ba") Trigram("Gua") images interchanging" happens is by means of changing lines.  for instance if you start with earth (all three yin) but the middle line is changing, then you will soon have water (a yang line surrounded by 2 yin).
<br />
<br />


## About each of the Ba-gua
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 雷 以 動 之 | By the thunder we are stirred |
| 風 以 散 之 | By the wind we are dispersed |
| 雨 以 潤 之 | By the rain we are watered |
| 日 以 烜 之 | By the sun we are lighted |
| 艮 以 止 之 | By the mountain we are blocked |
| 兌 以 說 之 | By the lake we are persuaded |
| 乾 以 君 之 | By the heavens we are governed |
| 坤 以 藏 之 | By the earth we are harbored |

<br />

### My thoughts on that
I think the intention here is to identify the very most fundamental property of each of the 8 trigrams.

I find it interesting that some of these use the name of the trigram and some dont.\
For instance, "rain" and "sun" are NOT the same characters as the ones used in other places as the names of the fire and water trigrams.

Its not that it is strange that there are two characters for the same idea, its strange that it wasnt consistent here using the one or the other

乾 is used as the name for the heaven Trigram, as well as the Hexagram that has Heaven/Heaven.
but normally, when we speak of heaven, we use 天 as the symbol.

The same holds true for the other trigrams and thier matching double-hexagrams.
坤 is Earth, but when we speak of earth, we generally use 地.

雷 is Thunder's Gua, but we commonly call it 霹

巽 is Wind's Gua, but we speak of 風wind (like what was used here), or sometimes we speak of this gua as 木"wood/tree"

艮 is the Mountain Gua, but we speak of 山

兌 is for lake (I prefer lake as the translation. but its probably more correclty called "wetlands", other translaters sometimes prefer "marsh")
"Lake" is what happens to water after its done moving.  After it descends from the heavens, and rolls through the streams, and comes to a rest in the valley, it pools, and is the focal point of life in that area.  It is the main plaza.  It is where buying and selling occur, where the party is at.
in other places, when talking about the wetlands, we call them 潢

坎 is Water, but we speak of 水
interestingly, this introduced "water" as 雨"rain", which is neither.

離 is Fire, but we speak of 明(light)
interestingly, this introduced "fire" as 日"sun", which is neither.

<br />

### Zhèn(Thunder)
Zhèn is the spirit the Emperor harnesses in order to introduce things.

it is the sound of a trumpet announcing the next move.

it is the email sent out announcing a new strategy.

the thunder, earthquakes, fireworks, loudspeakers, a shot heard around the world.

when effective, it is shocking.
<br />
<br />


### Xùn(Wind)
Xùn is the spirit the Emperor harnesses in order to blow away things he no longer wants.

it is the leaf-blower, the lawn mower, the vaccume.

it is the broom, the wash cloth.

the tooth brush, the shower.

when effective, it is penetrating (gets all the way to the center of things to dislodge them).
<br />
<br />


### Lí(Fire)
Lí is the spirit the Emperor harnesses to have visibility into things.

Lí is the spirit the Ancient Sages used to hear the needs of, and live in mutual benefit with all creation.

the lamp, the sun, the flash-light.

the audit, the weekly report, the witnesses.

the willingness to listen.

when effective, it is revealing.
<br />
<br />


### Kūn(Earth)
Kūn is the spirit the Emperor harnesses to sustain the masses.

the dirt (farmland), the caffeteria, the kitchen, the bunks.

when effective, it tends to be dirty, and full of commoners and common things.
<br />
<br />


### Duì(Lake)
Duì is the spirit the Emperor harnesses to publish ideas

it is the company's internal landing page.

it is the billboard in the entryway, the morning announcements.

ads, commercials, well planned propeganda.

when effective, it is visited frequently when people are open to ideas. 
<br />
<br />


### Qián(Heavens)
Qián is the spirit the Emperor harnesses to direct the battle.

it conveys the yin and yang energies downward.

it is the general.  issuing forth commands of yin or yang (advance, retreat, attack, rest).

it is granting funding to a project (yang)\
or defunding a project (yin).

it is deciding to enter new contracts, or aliances.

when effective, it motivates. <- this is only about 60% of where I want that to go
<br />
<br />


### Kǎn(Water)
Kǎn is the spirit the Emperor harnesses to get the work done

like the river, driving a mill.\
or a waterfall with a hydro-electric generator.

it can carve out the grand canyon or transport goods on barges.

the water has incredible power behind it that can do the work if you harness it.

when effective, it is powerful (and often dangerous).
<br />
<br />


### Gèn(Mountain)
Gèn is the spirit the Emperor harnesses to put an end to things.

Just as Zhen is used to put things in motion, Gen is used to bring them to hault.

I'm not yet sure how it is the completion of both the ending and the beginning, but yeah.

It is what happens when things reach completion.

note, this is not really aligning that well with the hexagram for Gen, which is about holding-still.

in my mind, there is a significant difference between non-movement, and reaching the end of something.

its also interesting that the holding still concept really fits nicely with mountains, which are pretty stationary.\
the mountain isn't really the final wrap-up completion of anything that I can think of.

when effective, it finishes
<br />
<br />

### Some notes on the directions.  
In ancient China, maps were oriented with south at the top. so if you draw these out on a page and want to visualize the placement, fire is at the top of the page, not the bottom.

Also, the placement of the symbols in these directions is attributed to King Wen, but before King Wen, there was a another layout of the trigrams attributed to Fu Xi, which (in my mind) is more balanced (and accurate). 
<br />

## undoing them
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 神 也 者 妙 萬 物 | those of the 10k-things which are mysterious are spritual |
| 而 為 言 者 也 | and act as that which speaks . |
| 動 萬 物 者 莫 疾 乎 雷 | those of the 10k things which are not stirring are dispelled via thunder |
| 橈 萬 物 者 莫 疾 乎 風 | those of the 10k things which are not twisty-branch are dispelled via wind |
| 燥 萬 物 者 莫 熯 乎 火 | those of the 10k-things which are not parched are dried out via fire |
| 說 萬 物 者 莫 說 乎 澤 | those of the 10k-things which are not persuaded are persuaded via lakes |
| 潤 萬 物 者 莫 潤 乎 水 | those of the 10k things which are not moist are moistened by water |
| 終 萬 物 始 萬 物 者 莫 盛 乎 艮 | those of the 10k-things which are not finished or started are restrained via Mountain |
| 故 水 火 相 逮 | ergo, water and flame together undo |
| 雷 風 不 相 悖 | thunder and wind do not each other resist |
| 山 澤 通 氣 | mountain and lake interact through the air(qi) |
| 然 後 能 變 化 | thus afteward are able to change-transform |
| 既 成 萬 物 也 | then competing the 10k-things . |

<br />

### what?
that makes no sense at all to me.
why leave out heaven and earth?
why "undo eachother" and "dont fight with each other".
and how is that related at all to "interacting through the qi".
and in what way does any of that make the trigam able to change-ization.
and in what way does that then complete the 10k-things?
