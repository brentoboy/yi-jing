## The Origin of the solid and broken "Yao" lines
| Original | English Translation |

| 昔 者 聖 人 之 作 易 也 | The ancient sages who wrote the Yi(Changes) . |
| 幽 贊 於 神 明 | in remote (solitude) were favored by divine illumination |
| 而 生 蓍 | and created the yarrow-stalk (method of divination) |
| 參 天 兩 地 | (Which is ... ) 3: heaven, 2: earth |

| 而 立 卦 | and drew up the "Gua" |
| 發 揮 於 剛 柔 | the coming forth (then) fading away of firm (then) yeilding |
| 而 生 爻 | and created the "Yao"(Lines that compose a Gua) |
| 和 順 於 道 德 | (they) harmoniously followed the Way("Dao") Virtues("De") | 
| 而 理 於 義 | and oversaw with integrity |

| 以 至 於 命 | thereby obtaining life's fullness |
<br />

### summary so far .. 
YiJing was written by ancient sages
who were inspired to use yarrow sticks as a method of divination.
They counted yarrow sticks. 
3 meant heaven, and 2 meant earth.
(I assume they took a handful, and systematically discarded them in groups until they ended up with either 2 or 3 remaining sticks)
Heaven/Earth being the original two "gua" (gua = answers they could get by consulting yarrow sticks).

The gua were "drawn" using lines called "yao".
A solid line was used to draw a yao that was "firm" or "yang" (a property of heaven).
A broken line was used to draw a yao that was "yeilding" or "yin" (a property of earth).

After divining the situation, the sages could live in accordance with the Dao of the moment.
They used this insight to manage thier lives in Virtue("De"),
In harmony with the Way("Dao") they emptied themselves until they reached life's fullness (died).

## Three domains ... for yin and yang expression
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 昔 者 聖 人 之 作 易 也 | The ancient sages who wrote the Yi(Changes) . |
| 將 以 順 性 命 之 理 | leading (life) by following the essence (divination result) to life-manage |
| 是 以 立 天 之 道 曰 陰 與 陽 | through this drafted heaven's way in terms of yin together-with yang |
| 立 地 之 道 曰 柔 與 剛 | drafted earth's way in terms of the soft and the hard |
| 立 人 之 道 曰 仁 與 義 | drafted up man's way in terms of compassion and integrity |
| 兼 三 才 而 兩 之 | combining the 3 and then paired them |
| 故 易 六 畫 | thus changes draw 6 |
| 而 成 卦 | and become a Gua (hexagram) |
| 分 陰 | distribute the yin |
| 分 陽 | distribute the yang |
| 迭 用 柔 剛 | alternately using the yeilding (and) the firm |
| 故 易 六 位 | old changes("yi") in 6 positions |
| 而 成 章 | and completed the phase |

<br />

### summary so far...
The sages built on their original observation\
(that things alternate between firm and yeilding: yang/yin,  heaven/earth.\
They realized that the heavens cycle between firm and yeilding: yang/yin, light/dark, day/night.\
And, the earth is also both firm and yeilding which manifest as hard and soft, stone/dirt, ice/water.\
And, that man also alternates between firm and yeilding. (firmness of character, and yeilding to selflessness) Justice/Mercy, righteousness/compassion, strictness/leniency, integrity/loyalty

Since the energies of the heaven, earth, and man, can alternate independently of each other, they can be combined together into "Trigrams" that together represent the yin-yang balance of the universe at a moment.\
Ok, it doesn't say that, it just says that they combined them into trigrams (images with 3 lines).

The "Jump" from 3 line trigrams to 6 line hexagrams isn't described here other than that they "doubled" them (I translated it as "paired" them up).\

The Yi-Jing text describes them in multiple relationships, such as Above/Below Outside/Inside.\
There is a new-agey philosophy that there are 2 universes, one outside of us, and one inside of us.\
The Macro and the Micro.\
The Above, and the Below.\
I believe the 6 line hexagrams are representing this dual-universe concept.\
If Heaven + Earth + Man = the Universe\
and there is an inner universe and an outer universe,\
that would explain the jump to 6 line hexagrams.  

But this text doesn't say any of that. It only says that they 2'ed the trigrams together.\
The resulting hexagrams can have change in any of thier six lines, or none of them.\
After all changing lines finish their change, the current moment/image is completed and this phase is over (the "change cylce is complete").

## The Ba-gua (8 Trigrams)
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 天 地 定 位 | Heaven (and) Earth in fixed positions  |
| 山 澤 通 氣 | Mountain (and) Lake interacting through "qi"(energy flow) |
| 雷 風 相 薄 | Thunder (and) Wind to each-other draw near |
| 水 火 不 相 射 | Water (and) Fire not each-other emitting |
| 八 卦 相 錯 | The 8("Ba") Trigram("Gua") mutually interchanging |
| 數 往 者 順 | the numbers which agreed with their previous |
| 知 來 者 逆 | know that those will next be thier opposite |
| 是 故 易 逆 數 也 | which is why, change("yi") to opposite that number |
<br />

### My take on what that just said
This appears to explain how each pair of opposite gua interact.
They are paired up by switching all 3 yao in each trigram to the yao of the opposite type.

heaven(☰) / earth(☷) 's positions are fixed relative to each other.

mountain(☶) / lake(☱) 

thunder(☳) / wind(☴) often show up together in the same storm.

water(☵) / fire(☲) dont really work together, or follow one another, or anything.  its interesting, the description of thier relationship is that they dont.

"the numbers" are positions, or line numbers.  the yao lines are numbered from 1 to 6, starting at the bottom.

"numbers which agreed with thier previous" are yao lines that are the same kind of line as what they were previously.  Meaning, whichever energy they are (be it yin or yang), they have been that way long enough to have become full.  

"know that those will next be their opposite" means that those lines which have reached that fullness of energy, be it yin or yang, ... you know that those are about to transition to the opposite energy.

So, if line 2 has been yang for some time,\
then it has built up to a fullness of yang energy.\
it is a "moving" line, or a changing line.\
Its the line where the Change(Yi) is.\
The Yi-Jing is the Book about those changes.

the idea here being that any (or all, or none) of the lines might be "old" lines, ready for change.

the way that the "The 8("Ba") Trigram("Gua") mutually interchanging" happens is by means of changing lines.
for instance if you start with earth (all three yin) but the middle line is changing, then you will soon have water (a yang line surrounded by 2 yin).

## About each of the Ba-gua
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 雷 以 動 之 | Thunder in order to stir them |
| 風 以 散 之 | Wind in order to disperse them |
| 雨 以 潤 之 | Rain in order to moisten them |
| 日 以 烜 之 | the Sun in order to cast light on them |
| 艮 以 止 之 | Gèn("Mountain") in order to stop them |
| 兌 以 說 之 | Duì("Lake") in order to persuade them |
| 乾 以 君 之 | Qián("Heaven") in order to govern them |
| 坤 以 藏 之 | Kūn("Earth") in order to store them up |

<br />

### My thoughts on that
I think the intention here is to identify the primary function or effect of each of the 8 trigrams.

I find it interesting that some of these use the name of the trigram and some dont.\
For instance, "rain" and "sun" are NOT the same characters as the ones used in other places as the names of the fire and water trigrams.
<br />
<br />


## The Gods ... Trigrams
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 帝 | The emperor... |
| 出 乎 震 | introduces via Zhèn(Thunder) |
| 齊 乎 巽 | disperses via Xùn(Wind) |
| 相 見 乎 離 | observes others via Lí(Fire) |
| 致 役 乎 坤 | distributes support via Kūn(Earth) |
| 說 言 乎 兌 | advertises words via Duì(Lake) |
| 戰 乎 乾 | battles via Qián(Heavens) |
| 勞 乎 坎 | toils via Kǎn(Water) |
| 成 言 乎 艮 | completes words via Gèn(Mountain) |

<br />
I think the "words" 言 mentioned in Gen and Dui are actually "ideas".
I would have translated it as such, but it really does say words, and idea is not exactly the same thing. ... similar, yes.

actually, I think this entire block is about the ideas of the soverign.

he announces his idea with thunder,\
spreads it out with wind,\
watches how others accept it via fire,\
uses earth to fund the effort,\
lake to promote or advertise the idea,\
the heavens to call the shots, issue commands to make the idea happen,\
water to do whatever manual labor has to be done,\
and then at the mountain the idea reaches completion.



## The 10k-Things ... Trigrams

| 震 東 方 也 | introduce via Zhèn(Thunder) |
| 震 東 方 也| Zhèn(Thunder) is directly East. |
| ~ | |
| 齊 乎 巽 | (are) dispersed via Xùn(Wind) |
| 巽 東 南 也 | Xùn(Wind) is South-East. |

| ~ | |
| 坤 也 者 - 地 也 | that which is dirt is Kūn(Earth). |
| 萬 物 皆 致 養 焉 | (it is) how to distribute support to the 10k-things |
| 故 曰 | hence was said: |
| 致 役 乎 坤 | "distributes support via Kūn(Earth)" |
| ~ | |
| 兌 - 正 秋 也 | Duì(Lake) - directly "autumn" (I assume that's synonomous with West).|
| 萬 物 之 所 說 也 | the location where the 10k-things advertise. |
| 故 曰 | hence was said: |
| 說 言 乎 兌 | "advertises words via Duì(Lake)" |
| ~ | |

| 正 北 方 之 卦 也 | straight north direction's gua. |
| 勞 卦 也 | toiling gua. |
| 萬 物 之 所 歸 也 | the place the 10k-things gather. |
| 故 曰 | hence was said: |
| 勞 乎 坎 | "toils via Kǎn(Water)" |
| ~ | |
| 艮 - 東 北 之 卦 也 | Gèn(Mountain) north-east's gua. |
| 萬 物 之 所 成 終 | the place the 10k-things complete ends |
| 而 所 成 始 也 | and the place complete begins. |
| 故 曰 | hence was said: |
| 成 言 乎 艮 | "completes words via Gèn(Mountain)" |

<br />

### Some notes on the directions.  
In ancient China, maps were oriented with south at the top. so if you draw these out on a page and want to visualize the placement, fire is at the top of the page, not the bottom.

Also, the placement of the symbols in these directions is attributed to King Wen, but before King Wen, there was a another layout of the trigrams attributed to Fu Xi, which (in my mind) is more balanced (and accurate). 
<br />

## undoing them
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 神 也 者 妙 萬 物 | those of the 10k-things which are mysterious are spritual |
| 而 為 言 者 也 | and act as that which speaks . |
| 動 萬 物 者 莫 疾 乎 雷 | those of the 10k things which are not stirring are dispelled via thunder |
| 橈 萬 物 者 莫 疾 乎 風 | those of the 10k things which are not twisty-branch are dispelled via wind |
| 燥 萬 物 者 莫 熯 乎 火 | those of the 10k-things which are not parched are dried out via fire |
| 說 萬 物 者 莫 說 乎 澤 | those of the 10k-things which are not persuaded are persuaded via lakes |
| 潤 萬 物 者 莫 潤 乎 水 | those of the 10k things which are not moist are moistened by water |
| 終 萬 物 始 萬 物 者 莫 盛 乎 艮 | those of the 10k-things which are not finished or started are restrained via Mountain |
| 故 水 火 相 逮 | ergo, water and flame together undo |
| 雷 風 不 相 悖 | thunder and wind do not each other resist |
| 山 澤 通 氣 | mountain and lake interact through the air(qi) |
| 然 後 能 變 化 | thus afterward are able to change-transform |
| 既 成 萬 物 也 | then competing the 10k-things . |

Thunder and wind are not incompatible

<br />

### what?
that makes no sense at all to me.
why leave out heaven and earth?
why "undo eachother" and "dont fight with each other".
and how is that related at all to "interacting through the qi".
and in what way does any of that make the trigam able to change-ization.
and in what way does that then complete the 10k-things?
<br />
