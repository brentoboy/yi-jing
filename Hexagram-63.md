### Ancient Commentary on the Judgement
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 彖 曰 | Tuàn says |
| 既 濟 | "Already crossing the river" |
| 亨 | "Prosperous" |
| 小 者 亨 也 | small things prosper |
| 利 貞 | "benefiting from virtue" |
| 剛 柔 正 而 位 當 也 | the firm and yeilding (yao) are correct and positions are balanced. |
| 初 吉 | at first, good fortune |
| 柔 得 中 也 | the yeilding is properly central |
| ~ | ~ |
| 終 止 則 亂 | in the end, stopping, chaos |
| 其 道 窮 也 | the plans exhausted |
<br />

### My Comments on the Judgement
The most "benefitical" thing is to have all the "little things" go well.
So the "virtue" of the moment is to stay focused and central and protect the core effort / progress.
"At first things go well", because you can follow the plan.
But, as the crossing continues, more and more unplanned "chaos" will unfold.
Until all of your preparations have been exhausted.
Upon reaching the other side, even if successful, you can expect it to end chaotically.

"the firm and yeildig yao are correct.. etc. etc.", I believe this is in reference to the placement of the yin yang lines. They alternate nicely, and they are numerically correct.  This gua is "perfect".
Even numbered lines are ideally yin lines, and odd numbered lines are yang lines.  Also, just as heaven is above earth, its "best" if each yin has yang above it, and each yang has yin below it.  that's ideal, as far as yin-yang lines go in hexagrams.
Much of the ancient commentary is about pointing out when lines are ideal in one way or another, and if they are "central" (lines 2 and 5 are "central" to thier individual trigrams, lines 1 and 6 are "extreme" outside lines .. not central, 3 and 4 get a pass because even though they arent extremes they arent as central as they could be".
Anyway, this gua's lines are flawless.

Its interesting that everything is ideal (as far as yao lines go) when you are in the middle of crossing a great river.
At a moment when a person wouldn't consider everything ideal.
But perhaps it is the moment when a person is at thier best.
Perhaps its the scenerio where life is the most fulfilling.

## The Image
☵ Water\
☲ Fire

### Ancient Commentary on the Image
| Original | English Translation |
| -: | -- |
| 水 在 火 上 既濟 | : water above, fire within ... already crossing the river |
| 君 子 以 思 患 | noble-ones, therefore, considered the dangers |
| 而 預 防 之 | and prepared to avoid them |
<br />


### My Comments on the Image
I think it is interesting that the wise thing to do when already crossing a river, is to have prepared yourself already.  Most of the images tell you what is wise once you are in a situation, this one is about doing what you can with all of those preparations you made.
The wisdom / virtue in action led to this moment.

In this image, the water is in the outer-universe (the above), and the fire is in the inner universe (below / within).
Water in motion is dangerous (see hex 29 for a view of double-water).  Water is unpredictable, and more powerful than you might expect based on looking at it.
The outside is not at all under your control.

The inside (fire) is generally associated with brilliance (see hex 30), and wise thoughts.  So, in this Gua, the person has control of their thoughts, and no control of thier environment.  And, by using thier intelligence, they master the situation.  its about keeping your mind keen and collected in the face of danger.
That's what the image suggests to me.

| 初 九 | 9 at the bottom |
| 曳 其 輪 | dragging one's wheels |
| 濡 其 尾 | dipping in one's toe |
| 無 咎 | its not wrong |

### Ancient Commentary on Line 1

| 象 曰 | image says |
| 曳 其 輪 | "dragging one's wheels" |
| 義 | the right choice, so... |
| 無 咎 也 | "its not wrong"! |
<br />


### My Comments on Line 1:
at the very beginning of the crossing (the bottom), securing your vehicle, and testing the water ... isnt a bad thing.
if you arent cautious at the beginning, when things get out of hand, what will you then do?
setting out recklessly leaves you holding nothing that you can sacrifice when the danger increases
